# Dynamic-bus-scheduling-System
# 🚌 Dynamic Bus Scheduling System

An intelligent and adaptable bus scheduling system built using **Python**, **NetworkX**, and **Matplotlib**. This project dynamically determines optimal bus routes and schedules based on real-time inputs such as bus stops, time windows, and passenger demands.

## 📌 Features

- 📍 Graph-based bus route modeling with **NetworkX**
- 🕒 Dynamic scheduling based on passenger demand
- 📈 Visual route plotting using **Matplotlib**
- 🧠 Algorithmic decision-making for route optimization
- 📊 Supports simulation of varying traffic conditions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Tkinter (optional GUI)
- Visual Studio Code (for running and editing the project)
